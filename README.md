# Code Katas

Every single part of this repository is practice and practice only

## This repo is volatile

I will not hesitate to delete the whole repo. Will try to keep the git history as much as I can.  
But for the moment being I created a basic gradle repository.

### Sections of the code

- I included this README.md to practice my markdown.
- There should also be a REPRODUCE.md doc somewhere where I can take notes of everything I've done, as to prevent me for forgetting some important steps

### Goals (Not in order of importance)

- Practice building projects from scratch
- Practice actual coding in several languages
- Create my own reference documentation 
- Maybe create source material for terminalJava.com
